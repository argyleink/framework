Welcome to the Famous Framework guides. These guides will teach you how to use the Famous Framework to create consistent, modular, and extensible Famous applications.

## Introduction

The Famous Framework is an open-source JavaScript framework that was created to work hand-in-hand with the [Famous Engine](famous.org/learn).

Architecture of components built in the framework is based on a pattern we call BEST, which stands for _behavior event state tree_. We think of BEST as an evolution from MVC. (Visit the [Core Concepts section](core-concepts.html) to learn more about the theory behind BEST.)

## Start learning

We suggest visting the [Hello Framework](HelloFramework.html) section first, and then working your way down the navigation. If you'd like to dive straight into a new Framework project, visit the [getting started](getting-started.html) section. These guides are organized to start at the basics and then gradually increase in complexity as you move along.

## Help &amp; troubleshooting

If you're stuck, head over to the [Famous Framework Slack channel](https://famous-community.slack.com/messages/framework/).
